For the first hour, I implemented the basic structure of the site with bootstrap.
I knew I wanted to have navigation be a column to the left of the site and have the site be
centered from that column in the page, since the navbar seems a bit too corporate and
unwieldly considering the size of the site. Looking through bootstraps nav items I chose
tabs to offer a simple way of delineating the different sections, and struggled with centering
the content in the page until stackoverflow clued me in on setting the body to be the whole
page so I can then center the container within the body.
